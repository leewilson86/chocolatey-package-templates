# Chocolatey Package Templates

A collection of Chocolatey Package Manager templates to compile custom nupkg.

These have been created where: 

* the official Chocolatey repository no longer supports older versions of applications
* the nuspecs in official Chocolatey repository are defective
* there are no existing packages available 

# Application lists

The current list of packages and versions include:

|Package | Versions |
|--------|:--------:|
| R      |3.1.0     |

# Usage

These templates can be customised and used to suit the purpose of your project. 

Each package contains a README.md with some instructions for how the templates have been configured to use, but they can be customised to suit your particular requirements.
